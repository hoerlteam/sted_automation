# ```autoSTED``` example notebooks

This folder contains various use-cases of autoSTED as Jupyter notebooks.

## Basic usage concepts

The following notebooks cover basics and are a good starting point (they also form the basis of the user guide).

- ```basics.ipynb``` covers the basic concepts of autoSTED
- ```save_parameters_to_json.ipynb``` covers saving of parameters to files, so they can be reused in imaging pipelines
- ```overview_detail_cells.ipynb``` covers the basics of constructing hierarchical overview-detail pipelines
- ```demo_overview_detail.ipynb``` showcases overview-detail imaging using **simulated microscopy** to test the framework without a microscope

## Applications in previous studies

The following notebooks (and their earlier versions) were used in published studies from our group:

- ```overview_detail_spot_pair.ipynb``` for DNA-FISH imaging
- ```overview_detail_nuclei_legacy.ipynb``` for imaging of DNA texture
